# USEFUL HELP
	- The default view shows a map with markers.
	- Clicking on the top left hamburger icon will open a bootstrap menu
	- There are two sections
		- A link with 'Top 5 places'
		- A search box and list
	- Clicking on any place in the menu list will oepn corresponding infoWindow
	- Typeing a query in the search input and clicking on the filter button will match the query with the list items and filter it.
	  Accordingly the markers on the map will be filtered as well.
	- Clicking on a marker will open an infoWindow with data returned from the Foursquare venues API about that location
	- If you click the menu title 'Neighbourhood Map', all the default markers will be shown.
